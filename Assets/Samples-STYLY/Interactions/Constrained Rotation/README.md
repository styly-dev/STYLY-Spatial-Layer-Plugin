This sample demonstrates how to constrain rotation of objects.
This is basically the same as settings to make objects grabbable and is using `XR Grab Interactable` component.
The difference is constraint setting in `Rigid Body` component.
To freeze rotation of objects, please mark axes in `Freeze Rotation` as checked. (Please note that all the settings for `Freeze Movement` are marked as checked.)
