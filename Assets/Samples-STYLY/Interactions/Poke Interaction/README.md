This sample demonstrates how to realize poke interaction for a button.
The button is toggled on and off when users poke it or pinch-select it.
To let users to poke an object, we should use "XR Poke Filter" and "XR Simple Interactable" components.
To capture the poke interaction, we can use "Hover Entered" and "Hover Exited" events.
Please check the component settings of "Poke Button" and the VisualScripting graph in this folder.
