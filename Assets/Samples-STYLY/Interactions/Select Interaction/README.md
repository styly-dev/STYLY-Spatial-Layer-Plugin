This sample demonstrates how to realize simple object interactions by tapping (gaze and pinch).
The buttons are toggled on and off when users tap them and the color of the object changes.
To let users to interact with objects, we need "XR Simple Interactable" components.
To capture the interactions, we can use "Hover Entered" events.
Please check the component settings of "Select Target"s and the VisualScripting graph in this folder.
