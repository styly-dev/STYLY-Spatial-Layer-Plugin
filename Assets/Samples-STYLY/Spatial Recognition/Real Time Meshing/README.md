STYLY for Vision Pro supports generating real time mesh of physical environments (walls, floors, objects etc). This folder includes the following samples. To use real time meshing, please put "EnableRealTimeMeshOccluderAndCollider" prefab in your scene. If you want to control by your own  VisualScripting graph (e.g. timing to generate, mesh settings etc), please create a new VisualScripting graph and include "EnableRealTimeMeshingSubgraph" in it.

# Real Time Mesh Occlusion and Collider Sample
The content generates shape mesh. Spheres and cubes are generated periodically and interacts with physical space.

# Real Time Mesh with Color Material Sample
The content generates shape mesh with a yellow transparent material. You can refer to this example to change the color or the textures of your room.
