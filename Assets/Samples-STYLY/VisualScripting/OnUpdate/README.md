You will learn the concept of OnUpdate callback of Unity. On every frame, the script will be called and set the rotation to the target object. Please check the graph in this folder.

Quatenion is a diffcult concept of managing rotation to understand. However, the "Angle Axis" node makes it easier to handle. The vector is the axis you want to rotate around and the float is the angle you want to rotate.
