You will learn how to send events and receive events. Please check the graphs in this folder.
The graph attached with the "Event Sender" GameObject sends events to its children.
It sends an event to "Event Receiver 1" GameObject after 3 seconds and "Event Receiver 2" GameObject after another 3 seconds.
Once the chlidren receive the event, they will be rotated around the Y axis.
