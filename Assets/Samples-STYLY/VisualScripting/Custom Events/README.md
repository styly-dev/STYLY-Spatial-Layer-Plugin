This sample demonstrates how to send events and receive events using Visual Scripting.
The graph attached to the "Event Sender" GameObject sends events to its children.
The graph sends an event to the "Event Receiver 1" GameObject after 3 seconds and to the "Event Receiver 2" GameObject after another 3 seconds.
When the children receive the event, they will be rotated around the Y axis.
